# Dumb-Botnet
*This is a personal project still in process*

In a recent security engineering interview, I got asked about all the things I would consider when building a botnet. I had so much fun discussing that topic that I realized that building my own botnet to use in a lab sounded like a perfect personal project.

Of course, do not dare to think that this Botnet's code is any similar to a realistic one. However, I think this is great for educational purposes.
